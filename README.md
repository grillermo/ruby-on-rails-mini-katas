# Ruby On Rails 8 Mini Katas


## What is this?
A repository of mini-katas to practice Ruby On Rails 8.

The purpose is to practice solving small challenges in the most railsy way possible. 
In contrasts with larger katas these challenges are meant to be small exercises that can be solved quickly
in less than an hour. 


## Why?

In a world where AI does all the syntax writting, doing katas becomes imperative to avoid skill rot. 
But most of us don't have the time to solve larger challenges like, build an e-commerce site with 30 features. 
Small exercises should help keep your 'muscle' memory without major time investments.
